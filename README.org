* Introduction

The =ox_log= python package is used to do some very simple, lightweight
log analysis (especially in the flask web framework).

If you want to do something complicated, there are lots and lots of
log parsing, sending, and visualization tools. Unfortunately, some of
those systems take some time to understand and setup.

If you just want a very simple, easy to setup system to show some
information from your logs, then =ox_log= is for you!
